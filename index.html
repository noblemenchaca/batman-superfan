          <p>
            The Joker, Clown Prince of Crime, is Batman's
            arch-nemesis. An agent of chaos known for his
            purple three-piece suit and insidious smile,
            he has caused Batman more suffering than any
            other villain he has ever faced. His origin,
            name, and true motivations are unknown in
            mystery.

            Ra's al Ghul, whose name translates to "The
            Demon's Head", is the centuries-old leader
            of the League of Assassins. He seeks to
            purge humanity of crime and corruption,
            utilizing the rejuvenating Lazarus Pits
            to maintain his immortality. Though Ra's
            seeks to make Batman his successor,
            Batman opposes him.

          <p>
            Formerly the D.A. of Gotham City, Harvey Dent
            was an ally of Batman and Commissioner Gordon
            until he had acid thrown onto the left side
            of his face by a mob boss, scarring him for
            life. The incident drove Harvey insane and
            he became Two-Face, obsessed with chance
            and always carrying a double-headed coin,
            which he flips to determine his every
            decision.

          <p>
            Edward Nigma is a villain obsessed with
            riddles, puzzles, and brain teasers, who
            took the alias of the Riddler to commit
            crimes. Riddler frequently tries to outsmart
            Gotham's hero Batman, but is always
            defeated by the Dark Knight. After
            spending some time 'reformed' working
            as a Private Investigator in Gotham,
            he has returned to his old villainous
            ways.

            world's plant life by any means necessary.

            though they have, on occasion, fought on the
            same side.

            Intelligent, rich and sophisticated; Oswald
            Cobblepot puts up a gentlemanly front, but
            behind closed doors he is the angered, power
            hungry criminal known as The Penguin. He
            shows flashes of compassion sometimes,
            but he is dominated by a desire to be
            respected and to control those around
            him.

            The Scarecrow is an overly-obsessive and
            deranged ex-professor of psychology who
            uses a variety of drugs and psychological
            tactics to play on the fears and phobias of
            his adversaries. He does not commit his
            crimes for wealth, but rather as a form
            of "research" to further study the
            effects of fear on humans and to satisfy
            his own psychopathic desires.

            One of Batman's earliest villains, preceding even the Joker
            and Catwoman, Dr. Hugo Strange is a brilliant but disturbed
            psychologist who forms an obsessive vendetta against Batman.
            He is also one of the few villains who have successfully
            deduced that the Batman's real identity is Bruce Wayne.

            After his wife became terminally ill, Dr. Victor Fries
            devoted his life to saving her and used cryogenics to
            freeze her to get time to find a cure. After being
            attacked by his boss Ferris Boyle and exposed to some
            of his chemicals, Fries could only survive in sub-zero
            temperatures and built a special suit to keep himself
            alive, becoming Mr Freeze.

            embraced a delusion that he was the incarnation of a

            hypnotic skills for mesmerism, Tetch as the Mad
            Hatter has committed many crimes, often themed
            around the book that inspired him and his love
            of hats and headgear.
